# Bachelor Thesis
This repo contains my Bachelor's Thesis (2021) from the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics & Informatics. The title of the paper is: *Securing Information using Steganographic Techniques*. 

Throughout this paper, I present some of the most famous Steganography Algorithms and I propose an improved method for LSB. Algorithms presented:
1. LSB - Naive Implementation
2. LSB - using Linked List Concepts
3. LSB - using K-Means Clustering
4. LSB Proposed (Improved Method) - using AES and Pixel Sequence (Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm - Durstenfeld's Version)
5. DCT
